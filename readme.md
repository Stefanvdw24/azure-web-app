The github repository for the following site:

http://dsvdw-web-app.azurewebsites.net

I used the code from section 6 of the following course as a basis (except for a fix I made).

https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide/

Adding the helper function in section 71 makes Azure display "Not Found" instead of displaying the html page, so I omitted it. It seems unnecessasary to add this functionality, so I should just remember to avoid it.

To-do:
Work through more modules in the course and implement new things learned. (currently on the MVC section)
add more pages on this web app that showcase my JS an CSS skills
